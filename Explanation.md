This code defines a method `reverseVowels` that takes a string `s` and reverses the positions of its vowels while keeping the non-vowel characters in their original positions. 
It first creates a list of characters from the input string and sets two pointers, `i` at the start and `j` at the end of the list. 
The method then iterates with these pointers moving towards each other, swapping vowels when both pointers land on vowels. 
If a pointer lands on a non-vowel, it moves to the next character without making a swap. Finally, it joins the modified list of characters back into a string and returns it.
